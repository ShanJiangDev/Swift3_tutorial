        // Instance Method: Classes, structures and enumerations can all define instance methods, which encapsulate specific tasks and functionality for working with an instance of a given type.

        //      1. Providing ways to access and modify instance properties.

        // Definitation: Every instance of a type has an implicit property called self, which is exactly equivalent to the instance itself. We use the self property to refer to the current instance within its own instance method
        
        // then the increment() method in the example above coule have been written like this:
        
//        func increment(){
//            self.count += 1
//        }
        
        // We dont need to write self in the code very often, because Swift assumes that you are referring to a property or method of the current instance whenever you use a know property or method name within a method. Thats why we only use "count" instead of "self.count"
        
        // When use self. : When a parameter name for an instance method has the same name as a property of that instance. -> In this situation, the parameter name takes precedence, and it becomes necessary to refer to the property in a more qualified way. Here use self property to distinguish between the prameter name and the property name. as example below:
        
        struct Point {
            var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
            func isToTheRightOf(x: Double) -> Bool {
                // self.x referes to the property inside Point
                // x referes to the parameter this function takes
                return self.x > x
            }
        }
        
        let somePoint = Point(x: 4.0, y: 5.0)

        // Structures and enumerations are value types. By default, the properties of a value type cannot be modified from within its instance methods.
        
        // However, if you need to modify the properties of your structure or enumeration within a particular method, you can opt in to mutating behavior for that method. The method can then mutate(change) its properties from within the method, and any changes that it makes are written back to the original structure when the method end. The method can also assign a completely new instance to its implicit self property, and this new instance will replace the existing one when the method ends.
        
        // Use opt behavior by placing "mutating" keyword before the func keyword for that method
