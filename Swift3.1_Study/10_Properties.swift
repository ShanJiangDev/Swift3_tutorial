        // 4. Property observers: Defined property observers to monitor changes in a property's value, which you can respond to with custom actions. Property observers can be added to stored properties you define yourslef, and also to properties that a subclass inherits from its superclass.

        // 1, When the initial value for a property is dependent on outside factors whose values are not known untill after an instance's initialization is complete.
        // 2. When the initial value for a property requires complex or computationally expensive setup that should not be performed unless or until its needed.
