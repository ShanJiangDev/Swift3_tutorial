        //  1. Provide a custom getter (and setter, if appropriate) to override any inherited property, regardless of whether the inherited property is implemented as a stored or computed property at source.
        //  2. Must always state both the name of the type of that property you are overridng, to enable the compiler to check that your override mathches a superclass property with the same name and type.
        //  3. You can present an inherited read-only property -> read-write property.
        //     You can not present an inherited read-write property -> read-only property.
        
        // 3.1 When you provide a setter as part of property override, you must also provide a getter for the override. If you dont want to modify the inherited property's value within the overriding getter, use: super.someProperty from the getter, where someProperty is the name of the property you are overriding.

        // Can Not: add property observers to
        // 1. inherited constant stored properties
        // 2. inherited read-only computed properties.
        // Value of these two properties cannot be set, and so it is not appropriated to provide a willSet or didSet implementation as part of an override.
        
        // Can Not: add both an overriding setter and an overriding property observer for the same property. Because if you want to observe changes to a property's value, the customer setter for that property already can do this job.
