        // Both Classes and Structures has these features
        // 1. Define properties to store values
        // 2. Define methods to provide functionality
        // 3. Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
        // 4. Define initializers to set up their initial state
        // 5. Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
        // 6. Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
        
        // Class have additional capabilities that structures do not:
        // 1. Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
        // 2. Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime
        // 3. Definitializer enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned
        // 4. Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
        
        // Structure have additional capabilities that Class do not:
        // 1. Memberwise initializers: Initialize a new instance of structure with given value for its default properties.  check -- "4. Memberwise Initializers for Structure Types"
